Autumn nears. The branches yellow.And again the heart is ripped to shreds…A human’s life begins with sorrow, while youcling to butterfly-brief happiness.A human’s life begins with sorrow. Just look:the hothouse roses in him choke to death.While from some distant path awaiting sunrisethe steamboats wail of parting in the night.A human’s life begins…No, wait a second.There are no words to help us here at all.Outside the window poured a heavy rain.You’re ready for the rain, as a bird for flight.In the woods our footprints melt,as pallid passions melt into the past —Those meagre storms in a glass of water…And again the heart is ripped to shreds.
